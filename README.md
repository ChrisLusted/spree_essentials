# Spree Essentials [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/citrus/spree_essentials.png)](http://travis-ci.org/citrus/spree_essentials)


Spree Essentials is the base for many content related extensions for Spree. It doesn't do much on it's own ;)

Spree Essentials provides other extensions with:

* An asset-upload interface
* An easy markdown editor with ajax preview
* Image picker for embedding uploaded images into markdown editor
* A common navigation tab ("Content")
* A shared `test_helper.rb`

Current essential-aware extensions include:

* [spree_essential_cms](https://github.com/citrus/spree_essential_cms): A full featured CMS with pages, contents, images and more
* [spree_essential_blog](https://github.com/citrus/spree_essential_blog): A blog complete with archives, categories, tags and related products
* [spree_essential_news](https://github.com/citrus/spree_essential_news): A news system, also complete with archives, tags and related products. (yes it's pretty much the exact same thing as the blog)
* [spree_essential_press](https://github.com/citrus/spree_essential_press): A simple press page for displaying media related content.



Installation
------------

If you don't already have an existing Spree site, [click here](https://gist.github.com/946719) then come back later... You can also read the Spree docs [here](http://spreecommerce.com/documentation/getting_started.html)...

Spree Essentials can be installed by itself by adding the following to your Gemfile:
      
    # Spree 1.0.x
    gem 'spree_essentials', '~> 0.4.0.rc2'

    # Spree 0.70.x
    gem 'spree_essentials', '~> 0.3.3'

    # Spree 0.60.x
    gem 'spree_essentials', '~> 0.2.3'
  
This isn't necessary if you're using spree_essentials based extensions. If that's the case, just include the extensions normally:
  
    gem 'spree_essential_cms'
    gem 'spree_essential_blog'

    
Then run:
    
    bundle install


Once that's complete, run the migration generator and migrate your database:

To see your available generators run
 
    rails g
 
    
Now run the generators for extensions you wish to install    
 
    rails g spree_essentials:install
    rails g spree_essentials:cms
    rails g spree_essentials:blog
 
    
Then migrate your database:
    rake db:migrate


If that all went smoothly, you should be ready to boot the server with:

    rails s


Now login to the admin and click on the 'Content' tab!



Essential Awareness
-------------------

Spree Essentials is designed to allow other extensions to reside under it's global 'Content' tab in the admin. [SpreeEssentialPress](https://github.com/citrus/spree_essential_press) is the first of many extensions that can run with or without spree_essentials installed.

Setting up an essential aware extension is easy. In your `lib/[extension_name].rb` file, add something like this:


    module SpreeEssentialPress
      
      def self.tab
        { :label => "Press", :route => :admin_press_index }
      end
      
      def self.sub_tab
        [:press, { :route => :admin_press_index, :label => 'admin.subnav.press', :match_path => '/press' }]
      end
      
      def self.independent?
        return true unless defined?(SpreeEssentials)
        !SpreeEssentials.respond_to(:register)
      end
    
    end
    
    unless SpreeEssentialPress.independent?
      # register with Spree Essentials and reside under the "Content" tab
      SpreeEssentials.register :press, SpreeEssentialPress 
    end




Notes

Spree Essentials is under constant development... Development is being done on OSX with Ruby 1.9.2 and usually the latest version of Spree. (currently 0.70.0)
